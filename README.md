# Kubernetes

This repository contains my hands-on practice and learning journey with Kubernetes. It includes YAML manifests, configurations, and deployment examples for various Kubernetes components such as:

- Pods, Deployments and Services
- ConfigMaps and Secrets
- Volumes and PersistentVolumeClaims
- Real-world deployment simulations (e.g., Node.js/Express app with PostgreSQL and MongoDB)
